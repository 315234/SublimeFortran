SublimeFortran
==============

Comprehensive syntax highlighting for Fortran in Sublime Text 3.

Features:

 - Separate syntax definitions for fixed-format and modern Fortran.

 - Based on the new
   [sublime-syntax file format](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)
   and therefore currently requires a recent [beta version](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
   of Sublime Text 3 (minimum build number 3084).

 - Code snippets

 - Indentation rules

 - Linter based on `gfortran` (requires the package [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3) to work)

Pull requests are welcome :)
