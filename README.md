SublimeFortran
==============

Comprehensive syntax highlighting for Fortran in Sublime Text 3.

Features:

 - Separate syntax definitions for fixed-format and modern Fortran.

 - Based on the new
   [sublime-syntax file format](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)
   and therefore currently requires a [developer build](http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev)
   of Sublime Text (minimum build number 3084).

Pull requests are welcome :)
